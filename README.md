# Event-Selection-Optimization

This repository contains a project (provided in .ipynb format as well as .html for ease of reading) which utilizes data that simulates the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator. The project uses a pair of big data sets to optimize event selections in order to enhance discovery sensitivity.
